## Introduction:
IMDb Anime Dataset Platform is an online database of anime-related information. The users could register their account and log in to the platform to search for the anime they want to watch and see the details (e.g. rating) of the anime. If the users love some specific anime, they could add them to their favorites so that they can check this anime later in their favorite anime list without searching.
